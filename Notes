All G-MODE Archives games will be different processes for translating but for this specific one here are the things that needed to be changed to fully translate the game in English. Games in a "series" like this one and the 3 Beach Volleyball games it spun off of all seem to be structurally similiar so a lot of the same process can be done for those games, but YMMV with other titles. Will make a writeup for any future G-MODE translation patches.

Managed\Metadata\global-metadata.dat - Edited with https://github.com/JeremieCHN/MetaDataStringEditor/releases 

Don't have the time/resources to fork this and recompile in English but here is a rough translation to use this:
Top Toolbar:
加载 = Open file
另存为 = Save file (must create new file every time, cannot just overwrite global-metadata.dat)
关闭文件 = Clear/remove file
下一个 = Search

Columns:
原字符串 = Original string
新字符串 = New string
是否修改 = * if modified, blank otherwise

Click on string -> 编辑 = Edit string

Edit String Box:
保存 = Save changes
放弃此次修改 = Discard Changes
还原该串的修改 = Revert changes

Not many strings needed to be edited for this one, although there were 3 lines that were sneakily injected into the tutorial text from here, I guess that's how G-MODE decided to implement a change without modifying game files, for this instance anyway.

Unity assets - Edited with https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA/releases
